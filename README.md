# Storm place

This is (will be) **r/place**, but written as a part of the CHIP committee of STORM!
Tech used:

- tokio for generic async stuff
- tonic for gRPC

For tonic I was following [this tutorial](https://betterprogramming.pub/building-a-grpc-server-with-rust-be2c52f0860e)
and adapted it for my purposes. This very much a proof-of-concept project, I have no experience writing big rust/tokio
projects, and as such it looks like it. I designed the basics with some extensibility and performance in mind, feel free
to contribute!
